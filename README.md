# Grocery Store Backend

Welcome to the **Grocery Store Backend** repository! This backend powers the Grocery Store app, handling data storage, API endpoints, and seamless integration with the frontend.

---

## Features
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for managing grocery data.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MongoDB for secure and efficient data storage.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Enables secure communication between frontend and backend.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures robust and informative error responses.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle increasing traffic and data.

---

## Tech Stack
The backend leverages the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB integration.
- **Body-Parser**: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.
- **CORS**: Middleware for enabling cross-origin requests.

---

## Prerequisites
To run the backend locally, ensure you have the following:
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running
